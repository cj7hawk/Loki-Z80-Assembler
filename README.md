# Loki Z80 Assembler
 A z80 assembler for CP/M. Assembles z80 source code and includes both extended and undocumented instructions. . 

ALPHA version. The .BIN file is a functional Binary, and can assemble itself. Contains most of the intended Version 1 code, except Macro's and some cleaning up and bounds checking. Small and Fast. Runs under CP/M. z80 machines only. 

Just rename the BIN file as a COM file - eg, PIP ASSEMBLE.COM=ASSEMBLE.BIN or use REN ASSEMBLE.BIN ASSEMBLE.COM to make executable.
